The Project includes three files:

1. MyArrayList.java: The generic data structure that allows user to add elements to the end and remove elements at any index in bounds.

2. Startup.java: Contains main method that constructs an instance of MyArrayList, adds a random number of elements to it and print the string representation of the list to the screen.

3. MyArrayListTest.java: The test class for class MyArrayList, which tests all methods in two cases: a list of type int and a list of type string.
