Comments:

* Incorrect output for “a+b*c+(d*e+f)*g” and  “(4+5)*2”. [-6]
* Additional line of output containing operators only!
* It could be better to perform file I/O in separate class, which can be tested separately.
* Conversion method is too large, could be broken into smaller testable methods.
* Good documentation.
* Input file-name should not be hard coded in TestInfixToPostfix.java. You could avoid using file-input in the tests. [-1]
* testConversion() method should be broken into several independent test methods each dealing with a separate corner case. [-3]
* Good explanations in ReadMe.txt.
